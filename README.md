INTRODUCTION

1. Emotion detection, also known as sentiment analysis, is the process of identifying and categorizing human emotions expressed in text or speech data. This project aims to develop machine learning models capable of accurately detecting and classifying emotions in text data.
2. I employed three different models: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), to explore various approaches to emotion detection.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE

1. The primary objective of this project is to develop a model capable of accurately detecting and classifying emotions expressed in text data.
2. By achieving high accuracy in emotion detection tasks, we seek to enhance understanding and analysis of human emotions expressed through written communication.
3. I aimed to create a system that can classify text into predefined emotion categories, such as joy, sadness, anger, neutral, etc., with high accuracy.
4. This system holds significant potential for applications across various domains, including customer feedback analysis, healthcare, market research, and sentiment analysis, offering valuable insights into the emotional content of textual information.

MODEL ARCHITECTURES

In this project, three distinct models were employed for emotion detection:
1. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
2. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
3. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
4. Each model offers unique advantages and architectures for processing textual data and extracting meaningful features.

CONCLUSION

1. In conclusion, the project successfully developed models for accurately detecting and classifying emotions expressed in text data. Through the implementation of LSTM, BERT, and CNN architectures, each model showcased robust performance in emotion classification.
2. The project's LSTM model boasts a commendable 91% accuracy, particularly excelling in predicting joy and sadness, though it faces challenges with fear and surprise. Similarly, BERT demonstrates strong performance with 92% accuracy, showcasing robustness in recognizing various emotions, while the CNN model achieves an impressive overall accuracy of 91%, particularly excelling in classifying sadness and joy.
3. BERT's greater accuracy is probably a result of its skill at efficiently capturing contextual information using language representations currently provided. Compared to LSTM and CNN, this enables it to recognize complexities in text input more effectively, resulting in more accurate emotion classification.
